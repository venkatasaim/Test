Rather than discharging batteries, ingenious entrepreneurs discovered a business model to give spent batteries a second life.
Batteries are getting better but the longer life span can only be realized by applying moderate charge, preventing harsh discharges and adding regular battery maintenance.
All too often, batteries are replaced as a troubleshooting method. By doing battery maintenance, these batteries can be put back to good use to keep our plant green.
